# redux-starter-kit

*Do not use yet!!! Under development!!!*

There are many starter kits for React and Redux.
I crate one for my personal usage.

## Features

* Excellent component based hot reload - HMRE
* React with Redux as Flux backend.
* LESS support
* Only one webpack configuration file. Production build is invoked by -p parameter when calling webpack.

### Babel Compiler

This kit uses Babel version 6. This version is more and better modularised than previous versions.
